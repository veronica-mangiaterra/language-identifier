# language-identifier
    The aim of this project is to train a classifier that identifies in which language a text is written.
    The work is organized following these steps:
    1. Scraping,
    2. Preprocessing,
    3. Vectorization and training of the model,
    4. Evaluation
    
    1. SCRAPING
    I used Selenium to navigate through different pages and Requests and BeautifulSoup to get the text from the pages
